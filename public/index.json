    "body": "Well, I finally made it out for some winter fishing here in Mississippi. Kayak fishing often envolves getting wet and even a 50 degree day can prove challenging. Luckily, today we had a warming trend that got temps into the 70\u0026rsquo;s and provided some great fishing opportunities. So I packed up the kayak and hit the bayous along the Pascagoula. The shallow waters were warming faster, creating some very active redfish. I ended up fishing waters ranging in depth from 1-6 feet with a maximum water temp of 64 degrees fairenheit. Reds were coming out of the deep holes (relatively speaking) and moved into 1-2 feet of water. I saw multiple Reds pushing baits up towards the marsh edge, making for some explosive action. The bait of choice was a four inch paddle tail in the electric chicken color. I paid paricular attention to points and outflows where fish were holding and feeding. After locating a fish I worked my bait slowly across the the bottom with extra twitches periodically. This technique produced a beautiful red and a thiccck flounder (yes three c\u0026rsquo;s).\n",

    "body": "\nHello, my name is Matthew Byrnes. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Southern Mississippi studying Coastal Sciences. I have a bachelors of science from Purdue Uiversity in West Lafayette, Indiana (HAIL PURDUE!). My roots can be traced back to the hills of southern Indiana where I spent most of my childhood fishing and playing in small creeks and streams. This sparked a passion for the hidden \u0026ldquo;alien\u0026rdquo; world that lies below the waters surface. In the early days this fascination manifested in the form of a love for fishing. As I grew, so did the scope of my interest. Instead of just capturing fish I wanted to understand the world they inhabited. This led me to a undergraduate degree in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. During this time both my academic and fishing interests blossomed. I have been fortunate to explore fisheries from the upper peninsula of Michigan to the coasts of Costa Rica. The goal of this blog is to share my fishing adventures with others while also providing an academic perspective on fisheries.\n",
