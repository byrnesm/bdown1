      <description>Well, I finally made it out for some winter fishing here in Mississippi. Kayak fishing often envolves getting wet and even a 50 degree day can prove challenging. Luckily, today we had a warming trend that got temps into the 70&amp;rsquo;s and provided some great fishing opportunities. So I packed up the kayak and hit the bayous along the Pascagoula. The shallow waters were warming faster, creating some very active redfish.</description>
